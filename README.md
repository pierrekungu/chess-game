# Chess Game
A simplified chess game.

The ChessVar Python class represents a simplified chess game. It includes the initialization of the chessboard with pieces in their starting positions, the ability to make moves, and checking the game state. The class also provides a method to display the current state of the chessboard.

## Features
### Game Initialization: 
The class initializes the chessboard with pieces in their initial positions for both 'WHITE' and 'BLACK' players.

### Move Execution: 
The make_move method allows players to make moves by specifying the source ('from') and destination ('to') squares.

### Game State: 
The get_game_state method provides information about the current state of the game, indicating whether it is 'UNFINISHED,' 'TIE,' 'WHITE WON,' or 'BLACK WON.'

### Chessboard Display: 
The draw_board method displays the current state of the chessboard, allowing players to visualize the game.
